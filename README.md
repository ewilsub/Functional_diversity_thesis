Code and data to reproduce analyses of the study titled *Effects of urbanization-related disturbances on macroinvertebrate communities in a Patagonian river system: insights from a functional approach*, submitted for publication to Urban Ecosystems. </br> 


This research was part of my PhD thesis *Efectos de la expansi칩n urbana sobre la integridad ecol칩gica de una cuenca patag칩nica
Calidad de agua, h치bitat y comunidades de macroinvertebrados* (Effects of urban expansion on the ecological integrity of a Patagonian basin
Water quality, habitat, and macroinvertebrate communities).</br>

**Abstract** </br>
The expansion of urban areas has led to land-use changes that affect aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem processes through a number of ways, such as increased runoff, water pollution, habitat homogenization, and disturbance of the natural flow. It is well known that urbanization induces profound changes in freshwater macroinvertebrate communities, but relatively few studies have approached this topic using trait-based methods. This severely limits our ability to monitor and predict potential alterations of ecosystem processes. We here provide empirical evidence about the effects of urbanization-related changes on the trait composition and functional diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrates from Patagonia (Argentina). Macroinvertebrate sampling and environmental characterization were carried out in 13 study sites distributed across three water courses in the Futaleuf칰 river basin. We found changes in environmental conditions over the urban impact gradient, in turn accompanied by variation in functional diversity and trait composition of aquatic macroinvertebrates. Specifically, we detected lower functional diversity in urban and post-urban reaches, mainly attributed to shifts in the distribution of taxa within the functional space, rather to the extirpation of functionally distinct taxa located at the edges of it (i.e., functional evenness and dispersion decreased, but functional richness remained constant). We also found signs of functional homogenization at the most impaired sites, where gatherers and tegument-breathing taxa dominated. These changes were mainly explained by conductivity, biological oxygen demand, and oxygen levels in the water column.
